# Thesis - Crowd Tracker

I did one year research where I studied well renowned algorithms used in face deteciton and face recognition. I developed a system where you can perform face deteciton and recognition. It is merely a university project and can be used for reference or can be built upon. The performance is bit slow because I ran these algorithms on CPU not on GPU.
