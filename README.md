I did one year research where I studied well renowned algorithms used in face deteciton and face recognition. I developed a system where you can perform face deteciton and recognition on human faces in real time using web cam or on pictures/videos. 

It is merely a university project and can be used for reference or can be built upon. The performance can be bit slow because I ran these algorithms on CPU not on GPU. The major challenges were to detect faces at different angles. Therefore, I developed system using various algorithms and did some observation. 

MTCNN algirithm is really good algorithm that do real time face detection at different angles.
